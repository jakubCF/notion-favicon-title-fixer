# notion-favicon-title-fixer
Chrome extension that prevents Notion's favicon from changing to match the current page.
It will also check page title (browser tab name) and if there isn't "Notion" at the start it will add it.
Once this extension is installed, it'll always remain as the Notion logo with Notion title at the start of the tab name, making the tab easier to find when you have a bunch of other things open.

To temporarily restore the default behavior, simply disable the extension and refresh the Notion page in question.

## Installation

Download all files, unzip and add to Chrominium based browser
